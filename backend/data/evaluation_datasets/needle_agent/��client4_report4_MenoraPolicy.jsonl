{"question": "What medical treatment did Jonathan receive after his skiing accident?", "answer": "Jonathan was initially immobilized and given pain relief by a snowmobile rescue team before being taken to a first-aid station for examination.

He was then transferred to a hospital for advanced imaging, where his vitals were monitored and IV pain medication was administered during the ride.", "reference_chunk": "Only minutes later, at 10:50, a ski instructor on patrol noticed Jonathan lying on the slope in distress. The\ninstructor radioed for emergency assistance, and by 11:15, the snowmobile rescue team reached the scene. They\ncarefully immobilized his leg, administered preliminary pain relief, and secured him to a sled attached to the\nsnowmobile for evacuation down the mountain.\n\nThe descent to the first-aid station was bumpy, each vibration intensifying Jonathan\u2019s pain. By the time they\narrived at the cabin at 11:40, swelling around the knee had increased significantly. The on-site physician examined\nhim and, after initial testing, suspected ligament damage rather than a fracture. An X-ray performed at 13:00\nconfirmed the absence of broken bones but left strong suspicion of an ACL tear. The doctor recommended\nimmediate transfer to a hospital for more advanced imaging.\n\nArrangements were made swiftly, and at 15:20, Jonathan was placed in a private ambulance bound for Santa\nChiara Hospital in Trento, a journey of roughly 65 kilometers. The paramedics monitored his vitals and\nadministered IV pain medication throughout the two-hour ride, providing regular updates to the hospital. By the\ntime the ambulance arrived at the emergency entrance at 17:00, Jonathan was in visible distress but remained\nhemodynamically stable. Nurses recorded his vitals, noted the progressive swelling, and admitted him into the\northopedic wing for further evaluation.", "file_path": "data\\insurance\\\ufffd\ufffdclient4_report4_MenoraPolicy.pdf"}
